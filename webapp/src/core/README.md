# Core module placeholder

This directory hosts the geometric and folding domain logic translated from the original ORIPA Java implementation. It currently
contains foundational vector, ray, and line-segment primitives under `geometry/`, including robust intersection predicates used
by the document store and renderers. Future sessions will extend the module with face graphs, constraint solvers, and folding
validators.
